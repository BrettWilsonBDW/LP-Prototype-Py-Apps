# Linear Programming python Apps

This repository contains a collection of prototype linear programming (LP) applications that implement specific algorithms I learned in college. The purpose is to demonstrate that these mathematical models can be systematically programmed to solve LP problems in python.

## List of Applications

- Adding activities and constraints
- Data Envelopment Analysis
- Dual Simplex
- Duality
- Goal Simplex
- Graphical Method
- Mathematical Preliminaries
- Two-Phase Simplex

## pip packages used
- imgui==2.0.0 for gui
- matplotlib==3.9.1 for graphical method ploting
- pygame==2.5.2 for windowing 
- PyOpenGL==3.1.7 part of windowing and gui
- PyOpenGL==3.1.7 part of windowing and gui
- sympy==1.12 for mathematical preliminaries

Install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
