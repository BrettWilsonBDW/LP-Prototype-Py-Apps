# Linear Programming Prototype Python Apps

This repository contains a collection of prototype linear programming (LP) applications that implement specific algorithms I learned in college. The purpose is to demonstrate that these mathematical models can be systematically programmed to solve LP problems in python.

## List of LP tools

- Adding activities and constraints
- Data Envelopment Analysis
- Dual Simplex
- Duality
- Goal Simplex
- Graphical Method
- Mathematical Preliminaries
- Two-Phase Simplex

## pip packages used
- glfw for windowing 
- imgui for gui
- matplotlib for graphical method ploting
- sympy for mathematical preliminaries

Install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
